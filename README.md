# Node Express Handlebars

### Overview

#### What the Project does

I created a full stack applicaiton that allows you to add different types of burgers to a database, which you can subsequently "devour" or eat and they get put in the "devoured" pile. You can also delete those burgers from the database once they've been devoured.  

### Technologies used

This web app was created with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. I followed the MVC design pattern; used Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML. I then used Heroku to deploy the app.
